Host Scan : The scan is done using nmap -sP <ip address>.0/24 Which is the Automated pinging of Hosts in a network.
Find all ports : nmap <ip address> gets the entire results of the whole hosts which are connected to the network.
                this also checks the systems are alive and are listning for syn requests.
Check open ports : nmap -sT <ip address> which is also called as a full tcp open scan
                  also we can apply Stelthy scan using -sS as a switch.
we can find the manual for nmap using man nmap
to find a specific os : nmap -O <ip address>
there are several other nmap features too.
In windows Nmap provides a GUI which we dont need code to implement a full scan
below are the results of windows scan
